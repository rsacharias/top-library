# top-library

This is the first project of the _JavaScript_ course of the _Full Stack
JavaScript_ path in _The Odin Project_ (TOP) curriculum. It is about a library
application. The goal is to strenghten the key topics which are taught in this
course up to this point. This includes objects, prototypes and prototypical
inheritance.
